> Image Processing: Convex hull can be used for shape analysis, object recognition, and object tracking. It helps in simplifying the representation of complex shapes and identifying important features in an image.
&gt;Pattern Recognition: Convex hulls can be used in pattern recognition tasks, such as character recognition, signature analysis, and facial recognition, to simplify the representation of complex patterns and improve recognition accuracy.
&gt;Computer Graphics: In computer graphics, the convex hull is employed for collision detection, visibility determination, and culling algorithms, which optimize rendering performance by excluding unnecessary objects from the rendering pipeline.
&gt;Data Analysis and Outlier Detection: In data analysis, the convex hull can be used to identify outliers or anomalies. Points lying outside the convex hull of a dataset may be considered outliers or noise.
