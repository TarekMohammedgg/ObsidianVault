#### addressing underfitting 

### 2.overfitting 
the mode fit the training set extremely well , that cause high variance $\text{个}$

#### addressing overfitting 
1. Getting more data ( increase the examples , training data ) 
2. decreasing the number of features to avoid polynomial  function [feature selection](feature%20selection.md)
3. [Regularization](Regularization.md) (we don't regularize b parameter  )

to know what is [bias and variance](bias%20and%20variance.md)
