treat with each problem independent , that give me more space to solve the problem and find easy way (not complex ) to solve the problem 

**Example**
optimize cost function (J )
	gradient descent 

Not overfitting 
	regularization 


when solve the problem we treat with each other independently   

there are some techniques  تكسر هذه القاعدة
