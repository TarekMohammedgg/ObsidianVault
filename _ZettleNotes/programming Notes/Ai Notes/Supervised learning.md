any model we must explain some points : 
1. definition of the model algorithm 
2. the formulation of the model algorithm 
3. the cost function of the algorithm 
4. gradient descent   


Topics support supervised learning : 

[linear Regression](linear%20Regression.md) - (x->y) : predict the Number depend on the best line can drawn between points . 

[Logistic Regression (Classification )](Logistic%20Regression%20(Classification%20).md) - predict the categories small Number of possible outputs (limited ) .
