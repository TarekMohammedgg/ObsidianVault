any model we must explain some points : 
1. definition of the model algorithm 
2. the formulation of the model algorithm 
3. the cost function of the algorithm 
4. gradient descent   


Topics support supervised learning : 

[[linear Regression]] - (x->y) : predict the Number depend on the best line can drawn between points . 

[[Logistic Regression (Classification )]] - predict the categories small Number of possible outputs (limited ) .
