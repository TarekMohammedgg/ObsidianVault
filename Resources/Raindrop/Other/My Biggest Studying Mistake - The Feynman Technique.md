The Feynman (pronounced &quot;Fine-man&quot;) technique has changed my life. Reviewing all the study methods I&#39;ve ever used, this technique easily secures a place as one of my top five study methods. The basics of the technique are that you try to explain a complicated topic in simplified terms, allowing you to better understand the complex topic. Pretty simple right? I thought so. The only problem is that my grades went down when I first started using it, and my time spent studying went up; what was I doing wrong?

Who am I:

My name is Zach. I’m a fourth-year medical student in Philadelphia. I make videos about medical school, studying, and growth. I love trying new things and often mess up. However, every time I screw up I usually learn something. Whatever I learn I post it either on YouTube or on my website 🌐  (https://zhighley.com/​​).

I write a weekly newsletter 💌 (https://zhighley.com/newsletter/​​) linking the best things I read, watched, and listened to that week. Join the 2,700+ that read it every Sunday morning.
